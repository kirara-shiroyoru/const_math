This package includes several "`const`able math functions" that can be called at compile-time which `dart:math` mostly cannot, returning `const double`, and can be used as compile-time constants. 

They are `const` constructors of extension type on `double` implements `double`, therefore can be used just like normal double, with almost 0 cost.

> [!NOTE]
> This package is not and will not be optimized for runtime, if runtime optimization is needed for calculations, then consider using 'dart:math' or other libraries.

## Getting started

In `pubspec.yaml`, add

```yaml
dependencies:
  const_math: ^1.0.2
```

and run pub get. Import the package with

```dart
import 'package:const_math/const_math.dart';
```

## Usage

ConstMath has compile-time math functions that `dart:math` does not provide, implemented by extension type on `double`.

```dart
const mySinValue = ConstMath.sin(3);
```
If `ConstMath` feels too verbose, then you can do something like this:

```dart
typedef CM = ConstMath;
const seventhRoot2 = CM.rt7(2);
```

These values can also be passed as argument to other const constructors, or inside another ConstMath function. 

```dart
const sinOfSin1 = CM.sin(CM.sin(1));
```
